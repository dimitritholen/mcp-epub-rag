**Project Plan: Analyzing Codebase, Identifying Gaps, and Enhancing Functionality**

### ProjectPlan.md

## ## Analysis of Current Codebase
- **[ ] Review Dependencies**: Evaluate the relevance and version of each dependency used (`@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`, `@xenova/transformers`, etc.) to ensure they are up-to-date and secure.
- **[ ] Architecture Assessment**: Ensure the project follows a modular and scalable architecture, such as the 3-tier model (presentation, application, and data layers).
- **[ ] Security Audit**: Conduct a security audit using tools like Snyk to check for vulnerabilities and ensure secure APIs are used.

## ## Enhancing Functionality and Security
- **[ ] Implement Caching**: Use in-memory caching solutions frequently accessed data to improve performance.
- **[ ] Error Handling**: Integrate robust error handling using tools like `express-async-errors` and ensure proper logging with `pino`.
- **[ ] Input Validation**: Implement thorough input validation and sanitization using libraries like `zod` and `validator`.
- **[ ] Code Linting and Formatting**: Enforce consistent coding standards with ESLint and Prettier to maintain code quality.

## ## Testing and Quality Assurance
- **[ ] Unit Testing**: Develop comprehensive unit tests covering all critical functions using Vitest.
- **[ ] Integration Testing**: Implement integration tests to ensure seamless interactions between different components.
- **[ ] E2E Testing**: Conduct end-to-end testing to validate the entire workflow of the application.

## ## Performance Optimization
- **[ ] Optimize Database Queries**: Use efficient database query methods to reduce latency and improve data retrieval speed.

## ## Documentation and Maintenance
- **[ ] API Documentation**: Create detailed API documentation to facilitate understanding and usage.
- **[ ] Code Comments**: Ensure all critical code sections are commented for clarity and maintainability.
